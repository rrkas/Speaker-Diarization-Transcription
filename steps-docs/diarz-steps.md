now that you've extracted MFCCs from the AMI Corpus, the next step in the diarization pipeline is to use those features to learn speaker representations and group similar segments together.

Here's the high-level next step for diarization after MFCC feature extraction:

# 🧩 Step 2: Speaker Embedding + Clustering Pipeline

Summary Flow:
MFCC features ⟶ Speaker Embedding Model ⟶ Clustering ⟶ Speaker Labels

Let’s break it into detailed actionable stages:


## 🔶 2.1. Prepare Labeled Data for Speaker Embedding Model

Since AMI provides speaker labels and segment times, you can prepare triplets or pairs for training a speaker embedding model.

Each segment should be:

* MFCC features (already extracted)
* Speaker label (from AMI annotations)
* Segment time (to align)

Use these to create:

* Triplet samples: (Anchor, Positive, Negative)
* Or pairwise samples for contrastive loss

Tip: Use a speaker-level folder structure or CSV with (file, start\_time, end\_time, speaker\_id)


## 🔶 2.2. Train a Speaker Embedding Network (e.g., Siamese or Triplet Net)

Objective: Map MFCC input to a fixed-length vector (e.g., 128-d), such that:

* Same speaker → embeddings close
* Different speakers → embeddings far

Architecture:

Input: (T, 13) MFCC matrix   
→ Conv1D or BiLSTM/GRU  
→ Global pooling (mean or attention)  
→ Fully Connected layers  
→ L2-normalized vector  

Loss:

* Triplet Loss or Contrastive Loss

Output: 128-d vector for each speech segment

Optional tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Keras — all work well


## 🔶 2.3. Extract Embeddings for All Segments

* Once trained, pass all MFCCs through the embedding model
* Save one vector per segment
* This is your diarization feature space

Each segment becomes:

* segment\_id
* embedding vector (128-d)
* timestamp (start, end)


## 🔶 2.4. Clustering: Group Segments by Speaker

Now apply unsupervised clustering (since diarization is usually unsupervised):

* Algorithms: Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering
* Distance: Cosine or Euclidean

Tips:

* DBSCAN is useful when number of speakers is unknown
* Agglomerative works well if you roughly know the number of speakers (e.g., from AMI metadata)

Result:

* Cluster ID ⟶ Speaker label
* Assign each segment to a speaker


## 🔶 2.5. Merge & Output Diarized Transcription

Using timestamps:

* Align each cluster to the original transcript
* Output something like:

Example:
```
[Speaker A] 00:00–00:04: “Hello everyone.”
[Speaker B] 00:04–00:07: “Hi, good morning.”
...
```


## 📦 Summary of Outputs from this Step

* Trained speaker embedding model
* Per-segment embeddings
* Cluster assignments (speaker labels)
* Diarized speaker-attributed transcript


# 🔷 Step 3: Train a Speaker Embedding Network

**Purpose**: Learn a model that maps each MFCC segment to a fixed-size speaker-discriminative vector (e.g. 128-dim).

Approach:

1. Choose a loss:
    - Triplet Loss (most common)
    - Contrastive Loss (Siamese)
    - GE2E Loss (Google-style)

2. Network architecture:
    - Input: (T, n_mfcc) MFCC matrix
    - BiLSTM or CNN
    - Global average pooling
    - Fully connected layers → L2-normalized vector (e.g., 128-d)

3. Training input:
    - Use your segment metadata CSV
    - For Triplet Loss: Sample (anchor, positive, negative) triplets per batch

4. Output:
    - Trained embedding model
    - .pt or .h5 weights file
    - Script to embed any audio segment

# 🔷 Step 4: Extract Embeddings for All Segments

Once the model is trained:
1. Load each segment’s MFCC (segment_id.npy)
1. Pass it through the trained model
1. Save its embedding vector with metadata (segment_id, audio_id, start_time, speaker_id)

Store embeddings in a CSV or NumPy array.

This gives you:  
segment_id, audio_id, start_time, end_time, embedding (128-d), speaker_id (for eval only)
